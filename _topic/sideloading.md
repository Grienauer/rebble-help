# Opening .pbw files on Android 

Pebble watchapps and faces can be downloaded as .pbw files, and 'sideloaded' to the Pebble app.   
You just download the .pbw file, open it in your phone's file manager, and it will open with the Pebble app.
    
On some versions of Android, you will not see the option to open the .pbw file with the Pebble app. To fix this, download our app 'Sideload Helper by Rebble'. ![icon](/images/sideloading/charon.png)

The app is also available on [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/io.rebble.charon/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/pebble-dev/rebble-sideloader/releases). 
    
Once installed, you can now open .pbw files with *Sideloader by Rebble*, which will in turn open the app with the Pebble app!
