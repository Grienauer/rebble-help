# Getting Dictation and weather pins 

![noborder](/images/misc/voice.png)

Rebble offers a free tier which includes the appstore, timeline (with a 3 hour sync period), and everything else to get the basics up and running.   
    
Dictation (used for voice replies and some apps) and weather for the built-in Weather app require a Rebble subscription, which costs $3/month. You'll also help keep Rebble running! :)
