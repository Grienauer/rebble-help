# My watchface doesn’t show weather info any more, or the info is wrong

Unfortunately, some often used weather services have folded, or changed their API. Watchfaces using those APIs now can’t fetch their weather info any more.    

See if the watchface can switch API, or choose another watchface. Please note that this is unrelated to the Rebble Weather and Dictation services plan.
