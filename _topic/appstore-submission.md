# Publish an app to the Rebble appstore

So you've written a shiny new Pebble app or watchface and want to get it onto the store?   
   
First thing you need to do is build your app using `pebble build`, and make sure you've got the .pbw file.     
    
When you have your .pbw ready, head on over to [rebble.io/submit](https://rebble.io/submit)   

Once you're there, continue to the next step.

# Fill out the base information

The first 4 fields to fill are the basic information about your app.  
   
Fields marked with an asterisk are required, but you already knew that.

- **App Name** is the name of your application as it will appear in the store

- **Website URL** is an optional field pointing to a website. Perphaps put your personal site or twitter url here.

- **Source Code URL** is an optional field, here's where your github or other repo url should go if applicable.

- **Developer ID** is where your Developer ID should go. You'll have one if you have submitted an app to the store before. If not you can leave this blank.

# Select app or face

Select 'Watchface' or 'Watch app' depending on the type of app you're uploading.

If it's a watchapp, you'll also be asked to pick its category. Here's the breakdown from the [developer documentation](https://developer.rebble.io/developer.pebble.com/guides/appstore-publishing/publishing-an-app/index.html):

# App descriptions

Next you need to fill out the app descriptions.

- **App description** is the description of your app or face.

- **Release notes** should describe what has changed in this update. If it's the first release, just write 'hello world' or something.

# Icons

If you're submitting a watchapp you'll be asked for a large and small icon.

If you're submitting a watchface, you can skip this next step.

# Screenshots

Next you'll be asked to submit screenshots of your app or face.    
This is what is displayed on the watch in the appstore.   
You must submit at least 1 screenshot.

By default the screenshots you will upload will be used across all platforms. If you want to submit platform specific watchfaces, click the toggle switch:

Once you've uploaded at least 1 screenshot, continue to the next step.

# Upload a banner

Next you can upload a banner. This is an image displayed above the watchapp in the store.

Banners are required for apps, and optional for watchfaces.

# Upload your .pbw

Now you need to upload the .pbw for your watchapp or face.

Once that's done, press "I'm ready, zip me up!".

The tool will then create a .zip app bundle and download it to your computer.

# Almost there

All that's left now is to email it to [support@rebble.io](mailto:support@rebble.io) so it can be uploaded to the appstore!    

This normally happens pretty quickly, but can sometimes take longer. You will receive an email when it's live, how exciting!
