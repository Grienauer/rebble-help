# Weather or Dictation is unavailable

Dictation and Weather for the Pebble weather app require a [Rebble subscription](/subscription).   

If you think you have a subscription but these features still aren't working, press next.

# Check your account

First, visit [auth.rebble.io/account](https://auth.rebble.io/account) and look at the line Voice / Weather subscription.

If it displays 'Active', [re-run the boot process](/boot).

If it displays 'Expired', the credit card used while subscribing might be invalid. You can simply [subscribe again](/subscription) to fix this issue.  

If it displays 'Not Active', you might be signed in with a different account than when you first subscribed.   
Log out, and sign in at Rebble with the right account. Then, check your account and payment info again.

If you start a new subscription, you should then [re-run the boot process](/boot).

If you require further support, please contact The Rebble Alliance at [support@rebble.io](mailto:support@rebble.io), or ask on the [Rebble Discord server](https://rebble.io/discord). See ya there! :)
